# Python-2048
Here is my version of 2048 game implemented in python using pygame.

When I made this, I had recently learnt about the classes in python and really wanted to use it. So I decided to make this game. But, to be honest it was not easy for me at first but it was really a nice project to understand the concepts of object oriented programming.

I know that the code is not very nicely written and I am open to any suggestions to improve it, especially I found adding animations extremely difficult, in fact, the game still doesn't have any animations.

I hope you like it! ;)
